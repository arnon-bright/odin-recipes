    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>½ cup mini chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the buttermilk: Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside
        for 5 minutes to sour the milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large
        mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into buttermilk mixture until
        well combined; add flour mixture and whisk until just combined. Fold in
        chocolate chips. The pancake batter will be thick. Allow batter to rest
        for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until
        bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancake with a
        spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes.
        Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
